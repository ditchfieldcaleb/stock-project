# RealTime Stock Quotes

Hello!

This is my submission for the Clutch Scala Coding Exercise.

I started with the following websockets example from the play-framework samples repository:

<a href="https://github.com/playframework/play-samples/tree/2.8.x/play-scala-websocket-example">Play-Samples Websocket Starter</a>

The above linked example has the ability to only add stocks, and the values are generated, not real.

## How to Build/Run

First, make sure that you have the following installed:
* [Java SE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)

After cloning this project into a directory, run the following command to build and run the project:
`sbt run`

After a few seconds, navigate to <http://localhost:9000>
